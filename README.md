# Game-Savior-maybe
This is my first game. Based on Bubble Trouble.

# Basic principe
This is a simple game based on a popular game BubbleTrouble. You are the hero who is trying to save his village from dreadful monsters. Those monsters are bouncing around and you have to shoot into them to destroy them.
Game is controled with mouse movement and mouseclicks. In the beginning, you have 3 lives and slow bullets. During the game, when monster is hit, it sometimes drops a bonus (red ball). If you catch this bunus, your bullets become quicker.

This is how the game looks like:

In the very beggining a start screen appears with the introduction to the story and short description of how to control the game. Then first level starts. The game has 5 levels with increasing difficulty.
